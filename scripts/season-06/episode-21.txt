l right.
 what do you think?
mm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
ah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob b*at 'em up. What?
bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
, baloney.
od one.
ng her up.
solutely, I will do that right now.
gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
 some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
n phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
! Knew it!
hrough phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!

re, if you are.
s.
lk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
oa.
 recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
actly.
ah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
iet.
y, boss man.
s?
bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
dies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
m sorry, I meant later.
, yes. Sure.

l right, yes! It's a deal.
's a deal.
, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
ay.
want her to meet Michael.
y?
ey're both single, I have a sense they might-
u've been gone for a long time.
 is not that. Kevin! Oh!
ah! [hugs Pam]
y, how are you?
, I missed you so much.
!
ah!
ah!
aah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
en a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
sy.
's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
cks to be you.
uld you like to be our fourth?
at would be sublime.
l right.
, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
y, Michael.
s.
is is my friend Julie.
llo, how are you?
od. Hi.
at is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
lie laughs at everything.
 you work with Pam and Jim?
, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
iggles] I should hope not.
. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
y.
y, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
 course.
u want to play pool?
, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
.
d then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
ld that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
-hmm.
at's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
h, I love repartee.
 you?
ually means there's a battle scene coming.
, what do you do?
am an ESL teacher.
ally?
ah.
e, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
e you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
s. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.
 what do you think?
out what?
out Julie?
e's nice.
ah.
ah.
 you like her?
, yeah, sure.
 Pam was right?
out what?
out you two hitting it off.

ys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
ly three tickets.
 we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
op telling me how to spend my tickets.

w, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
 I know.
ey'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
ey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
id we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.

at are you doing?
m tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
chael, you don't have to do this.
hoking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
y, you two having fun?
d you tell them?
.
is is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
get it.
sabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?

od.
is looks like a hoot.
y, monkey, how you doing?
ack.
sten, can I talk to you for a second?
ay.
ok, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
's no worry.
's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
could see enjoying that.
, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
t we signed the contract.
ssolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.

ichael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.

en I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.
am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
ll, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.
ll, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
 that how you do it?
s it is. I am writing a book about it.
ally? How much have you written?
ve written all of it... in my head.
.
 you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.

aughs] You love drama.
know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
th this move, he can't get you.
ll, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
