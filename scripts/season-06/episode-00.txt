Since most of the office is away at some boring software training program, our girl group decided to sh**t our music video. People are gonna flip out when they hear our new song and they hear our group's new name.
Oh. Did we come up with a new name?
We did. Subtle Sexuality.
Cool.
[putting make-up on Ryan] You know when you love a guy and he's giving you mixed signals but you know he really likes you and you're sleeping together?
More eyeliner.
I'll never tell who this song is about. That is a secret that I will take to the grave.
It's about me.
It is, but I'll never say.
Yeah. This looks ok.
[who has been sitting at the table all along eating his lunch] Do you guys need to do this here? This is a public area.
It's our office, too, Oscar. [to Ryan] I think you might have too much rouge.
No. It's not gonna read on camera unless there's a lot.
How do you know so much about what's gonna read on camera?
Uh... I lived in New York for eleven months. [Kelly nods in agreement]
What can I say? I love music. If I had to choose a lifetime without music or without sex, I would go a lifetime without sex. Girls would find other ways to take care of me.
In this sh*t I'm a bride, but I'm also kind of a tough girl, so I'm gonna be smoking a cigarette.
And I'm the minister.
Ok, Erin. Just sh**t it. After I puff on the cigarette, I'm gonna put it out on my high heel 'cause that's what they do in music videos.
Are we doing this or not?
Yes! We're still setting up!
My blood-sugar is getting low!
Well, you know what? You should have had the end of the soy yogurt that I offered you.
Rolling? [Kelly inhales the cigarette, chokes and spits]
Cut. Cut.
That's it. I'm done.
We still have to sh**t our make out scene!
I've got somewhere to be.
Ugh! We're finished!
Is that a wrap?
He and I are finished. The show must go on.
Absolutely.
I have to throw up.
Good.

The sh**t was going really great... until Kelly and Ryan got into a fight. Then the poop really hit the fan.
Maybe you can do it alone?
I don't think so.
Kelly, I heard that you were looking for someone to replace Ryan.
Do you know someone?
I thought that I could do it.
This isn't radio, though. You know there's a visual component to what we're doing.
Yeah?
Would you be able to kiss him?
[sighs] We would love it if you'd hold the camera for us.
I would very much like to do that.
Oh. No. You have to wipe the jelly off your hands first. Sticky. [all turn when they hear Andy singing in the break room]
[singing to the tune of Beethoven's 5th] Vending machine. Vending machine. I want a treat. Something to eat. I want a treat. A little sweet. But not too sweet. What do I eat? Vending machine. Tell me what to eat now.
So they asked me to audition for Subtle Sexuality so I gave them a little [makes electric guitar sounds]. Followed by some [scatting]. And, I sealed the deal with [old school rap b*at].
[teaching Andy & Erin choreography] One and two and cross and cross. Down. Sexy, sexy, sexy. You guys got that?
Hey, uh, some of us are trying to work out there. What's he doing here?
He's your replacement.
This guy? You're really gonna make out with this guy?
Ryan, this video is bigger than you or me.
You really think you can replicate the chemistry that you and I have... with this guy?
We've met before...
I'll be thinking about you the entire time. [Ryan grabs her & kisses her hard]
They do have sparks.
I'll see you at 5:00.
Can I still be in the video?

The video came out amazing!
Amazing!
I cannot wait to see it for the first time.
Kelly got Andy to edit it for us in exchange for a small part.
When this blows up I'll probably go solo like Beyonce did.
You are so talented.
You guys. DVD. Finished. [everyone screams]
Oh
Oh - oh.
You don't return my texts
